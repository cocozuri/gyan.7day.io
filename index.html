      <center><p style="color:hotpink;font-size:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now-a-days, at the numerous schools and universities of the world, students learn certain secular subjects such as language, history, geography, science, civics, laws, customs and traditions of their land. This helps them in some ways and, through higher studies in these subjects, they attain some status also such as that of a professor, a doctor, a lawyer or an engineer. Thereby, they acquire some happiness too, but that is not in full measure and all round but is only trivial and short-lived. The aim of spiritual education at this Divine Vishwa-Vidyalaya is to enable people to divinise themselves so that they can attain the highest stage or status like that of Shri Narayana and Shri Lakshmi, the famous deities who had all kinds of happiness, in full measure. The object of this education is to guide man to attain Release (Mukti) from all kinds of sufferings and to be a devata (deity), i.e. to have divine qualities. Therefore, great stress is laid, here, on character-building and on cultivating in oneâ€™s self, divine qualities and on following the divine line (Divya Mariyada). By means of this education, man receives guidance and the might to be able to overcome sex-lust, anger, greed, attachment and arrogance, and thus to rise from the depths of degradation to the pinnacle of Purity. In other words, practical training is imparted here to help man achieve complete purity of thought, word and deed.</p></center>
