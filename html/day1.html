      <center><h1>What am I?</h1>
        <img src="../images/Day_1.jpg" alt="the soul" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the day, as people converse, they often say, "I am busy with this or that task at this or that place," and so on. Yet, they seldom realize who is the one using this singular letter 'I' to refer to themselves.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the terms 'I' and 'my' or 'mine' represent two distinct entities. The 'I' signifies the soul, while 'mine' refers to the physical body that the soul inhabits. Just as you wouldn't say, "I am the room" while sitting in a room, similarly, 'you' are not the body but rather, the body is like a dwelling or a cottage that belongs to you. To illustrate further, consider a driver sitting in a car; they control the vehicle but remain separate from it. Likewise, the soul is like the driver, steering the body, which serves as its carriage.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is the one that perceives through the senses; it hears with the ears, speaks through the mouth, and sees with the eyes. Therefore, you are essentially a soul, not a body. The body and its organs are merely tools for action. Think of the soul as a precious diamond, and the body as the elegant casket that holds it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the soul's departure from the body, the body is pronounced as lifeless or 'dead'. Consequently, people arrange for its cremation, as the body becomes useless once its precious inhabitant, the soul, has departed. When the soul leaves the body, people often remark, "The light has vanished, the essence that animated it is gone, and the show is over."</p>
	<center><h1>What is a soul? What are mind, intellect and Samskaras?</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is a sentient being, capable of consciousness, thoughts, and feelings. It is considered alive because it can experience pleasure, pain, bliss, and peace. The soul can initiate actions, make choices, and exert efforts, whether virtuous or not. Importantly, the soul is interconnected with the mind, intellect (Buddhi), and predispositions (Samskaras). The 'mind' refers to the soul's faculty for experiencing emotions, desires, and willpower. The 'intellect' represents the soul's ability to reason, make decisions, and understand. 'Samskaras' are the imprints or effects on the soul resulting from its past actions, good or bad. These Samskaras shape a person's outlook, tendencies, and habits, ultimately forming their unique nature or Swabhaava.</p>
