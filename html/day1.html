      <center><h1>Understanding the Soul</h1>
        <img src="../images/Day_1.jpg" alt="the soul" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first day of the course, the focus is on understanding the soul, its nature, and its relationship with the Supreme Soul. The lesson begins by clarifying that the soul is distinct from the body, and it is the soul that experiences pleasure, pain, peace, and unrest. The soul is the actor in the drama of life, and its actions have consequences.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book emphasizes that the soul is not the mind or the intellect, but it is the master of these faculties. It is the soul that directs the mind and intellect, and it is responsible for its thoughts and actions. By recognizing oneself as a soul, one can take control of one's thoughts and actions, leading to a more peaceful and virtuous life.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson also introduces the concept of the Supreme Soul, the Father of all souls, who resides in Paramdham, the world of souls. The Supreme Soul is the source of peace, bliss, and love, and it is through the remembrance of the Supreme Soul that the individual soul can attain true happiness and liberation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day concludes with a reflection on the importance of self-realization and the need to recognize oneself as a soul, separate from the body. By understanding the soul's true nature, one can begin the journey towards spiritual growth and enlightenment.</p>
