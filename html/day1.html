      <center><h1>The Soul</h1>
        <img src="images/Day_1.jpg" alt="the soul" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During conversation at all hours of the day, man says, “I am engaged in such and such business at such and such place” and so on, but he does not know who it is that uses this single letter `I’ for itself.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, ‘I’ and ‘my’ or ‘mine’ signify two separate entities. ‘I’ means the soul, and mine is the body wherein the soul resides. You are sitting in a room, you won’t say: “I am the room.” Similarly, ‘you’ are not the body, your body is but a tabernacle, or, say your cottage. A driver, seated in his car, drives it but is himself separate from it. In the same manner the soul is the driver incharge of the body which serves as a carriage also to the soul. The soul it is that hears by means of the
          ears, speaks through the mouth and sees with the eyes. Therefore, you are a ‘soul’ and not a ‘body’. The body and its organs are the means of action. The soul is a diamond, the body being the casket for it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is common Knowledge that the body is made of five elements. I am a soul, eternal and immortal. The body is mortal; I have got it to do
          actions and to experience the result of my actions. I am eternal and I am the doer and the experiencer. When the soul has relinquished the body, people say, “The light has gone, that which lived in it has departed and the drama is over.”</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul is a living or a sentient thing. It is said to be conscient or living because it can think and reflect and can experience
          pleasure and pain, so also bliss and peace, and it can bestir itself and make efforts and actions, good or bad. So, the soul is not separate or distinct from the mind, the intellect (Buddhi) and predispositions
          (Samskaras). ‘Mind’ is the name given to the soul’s own faculty or function of experiencing pleasure or pain or of desiring and willing;intellect (Buddhi) is the name applied to the soul’s own ability to reason out things or to take decisions or to cognise and know; the Samskaras mean the effect produced on the soul by the soul’s good or bad actions, already done. We can also say that the outlook, tendencies or habits
          that a man comes to acquire as a result of his actions or the attitude that the soul comes to have is what we mean by Samskaras or one’s nature (Swabhaava).</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul abides in the middle of the forehead. That’s why there is the custom of marking this spot with a tika (sacred dot). As a matter of fact, we have really to be firmly seated in the original pure nature of the soul, but the ritualistic devotees instead put a mark there on the seat of the soul. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The saying is common that ‘in the centre of the forehead shines a wonderful star’. When men cannot reason out things and want to bestir their intellect, they touch this place with their hand. When they are not contented with their lot and want to point to their bad luck, then also they place their hand there for the very simple reason that the soul, which is the doer as well as the experiencer, dwells here.</p>
