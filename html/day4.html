        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the fourth day, the course focuses on the World Tree and the concept of 84 births. The World Tree is introduced as a symbolic representation of the cycle of creation and destruction, with its roots in the Golden Age (Satyug) and its branches spreading through the Silver Age (Tretayug), Copper Age (Dwaparyug), and Iron Age (Kaliyug).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson explains that the World Tree undergoes a process of destruction and re-creation every 5000 years, marking the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. This cycle is called a Kalpa, and it is during this time that the Supreme Soul descends into the world to establish the New World and guide souls towards righteousness.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of 84 births is then explained. Each soul undergoes a total of 84 births, or lives, in the cycle of creation and destruction. These births are not limited to different species but are specific to the human form. The soul takes on different roles and experiences in each birth, accumulating knowledge and virtues, and striving towards liberation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day concludes with a reflection on the current period as the time of the confluence of the old world and the new. It is during this time that souls have the opportunity to awaken and prepare for the New World, by understanding the cycle of creation and destruction and striving for spiritual growth.</p>
