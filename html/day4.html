        <h1>God’s Creation — The Human
          World Depicted as an
          Inverted Tree</h1>
        <img src="../images/Day_4.jpg" alt="kalpa tree" width=400px; class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to elucidate the growth of this world and to illustrate the world-developments, God has compared this world with a Tree which may be called ‘the Geneological Tree of mankind’. It is also known as ‘Kalpa Tree’ because it depicts the history of the whole Kalpa (World’s full cycle), i.e. the beginning, mid-period and end of all the important religio-political dynasties of the world. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its origin was shown to us by God Father Shiva, the Seer of Time, by blessing us with divine vision and divine intellect. To make it easy and interesting for us to understand, God Father Shiva gave us guidance to sketch this Tree just as a teacher uses some maps, drawings and illustrations to make it easy and interesting for the students to learn certain truths.</p>
        <h3>History of Golden Age and Silver Age</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to elucidate this wonderful Tree, I shall start from its trunk. The first and the oldest world-religion, which should be called the Ancient Deity Religion (Adi Sanatan Devi-Devata Dharma) is shown here in the form of its trunk. In the beginning, there was only one religion, i.e. the religion of the deities, and there was only one dynasty, called the Sun Dynasty (Suryavansh). In the beginning of the Golden Age, there was the deity-sovereignty of Shri Lakshmi and Shri Narayana which set in vogue all righteous traditions and customs. The masses were, like their rulers, viceless and possessed of divine qualities, and were doubly non-violent, for neither through anger nor sex-lust did they ever violate the rules of non-violence. Because they were completely viceless and did good actions, so, even the elements were perfectly under their control. That is, there was then no elemental fury, neither ill health nor want of money or food. All the elements were clean and excellent (Satopradhan) and, therefore, were instruments of happiness. Since there was complete purity, peace and prosperity in that Age, kings and queens and their righteous subjects are shown to be invested with two Crowns— one a halo of light and the other a crown of jewels. They are called ‘deities’ (Devata) because they were naturally holy, habitually righteous and instinctively spiritual and viceless. To the names of these deities people prefix the title ‘Shri’ and they regard their every limb above vices, comparing it with a lotus which is always above the mud in which it stands. “The deities have lotus-like eyes and lotus-like hands” — this is what they say. There was such great mutual regard and love in those days, that it is said of the age that “a lion and a goat drank from the same stream.” There was unlimited wealth in India in those days. Hence the saying: “the land flowed then with milk and ghee.” India was a golden sparrow and the gold and silver were so plentiful that people used to decorate their houses with sheets of these metals and set these sheets with gems. Even the servants in those good old days were happy and prosperous beyond our imagination. Since people in that Age led viceless lives, they lived long and there was no case of premature death. They willingly gave up the body when they had reached a ripe old Age. That is why it is said that Death never laid its hand on them nor they died by accident, disease, natural calamity or prematurely. India of those days was a veritable Vaikuntha or Swarga. Because all people were at the peak of purity and divine virtues, they are regarded as 16 degrees pure, i.e. absolutely viceless, righteous to the fullest extent and like the full moon when it is at its brightest.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the souls of these deities of Golden Age had, life after life in Heaven, enjoyed happiness for a period of 1250 years, they lost two degrees of prosperity out of the sixteen that is held to be the highest. Then came what is called Silver Age (Tretayuga). The souls of this age were pure only upto 14 degrees (fourteen Kalas). The rule of the Moon Dynasty started then. Even then there were no vices at all but the divine qualities were no longer at the highest because they had declined by two degrees. Even then there was sovereignty of complete peace and happiness. At the commencement of this Age, Shri Sita and Shri Rama ruled the empire. Like the rulers, the masses were virtuous. The memory of Rama Rajya is still highly cherished and sung, and the saying goes: <strong>"When Rama was the king, like him were the subjects and the elite; Then prosperous were the people for, they upheld Religion and Right."</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Copper Age followed the Silver Age. By the end of Silver Age, the souls of the Sun Dynasty and the Moon Dynasty, who had, of course, transmigrated through several lives, had become attached to the things that are of the earth and are related to the body. They had become body-conscious. Sex-lust, anger, greed, attachment and egotism had, to some extent, begun to cast their shadows on them. And they had thus fallen from the state of purity and worthiness and become vicious and unworthy. As they forget their true selves and broke with purity, natural laws came to be violated. Even Nature deviated from her usual course, having thus begun to harm them, even though slightly.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inspite of this, people did have faith in their religion. But because of there being no Divine Knowledge (Gyan), they took to Bhakti. First of all came the worship of Shiva, the Supreme Soul. Because people were very affluent, the temples they built were very grand, having been inlaid with gold and set with jewels. By degrees, worship of Vishnu, Shri Lakshmi and Shri Narayana, Shri Sita and Shri Rama, came in vogue. People began to write the Vedas and other holy books and spend money and time over sacrifices, Hatha Yoga, austerities, pilgrimages and rituals. Now the purity and virtue that were in the Golden Age and the Silver Age were things of the past and were only remembered in sayings and sung in songs and narrated in the form of stories. Inspite of their devotion, worship, etc., people could not only not find release from the five vices, but they got bogged down deeper and deeper everyday in vices. They went lower and lower, and a good many separate cults like those of Shaivas, Vaishnavas, Shaktas, and several panths and sects were formed. Difference in opinion, schism in religions, debates on Shastras and disputes of all sorts increased. People had already become second grade in purity (Rajoguni), and their worship continued taking various forms, getting laid over with innumerable earthly desires.</p>
        <h3>Establishment of other Religions</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the decline of this one real Adi Sanatan Devi Devata Dharma, a good many faiths began appearing like branches coming forth from the World-Tree. About 2,500 years ago, Abraham founded Islam, then Buddhism was founded by Budha, about 2,000 years ago, Jesus Christ founded Christianity, one thousand and five hundred years ago, Shankaracharya established the class of recluses and hermits (Karma Sanyasis) and, about 1,400 years ago, Mohammed established the Muslim Religion. In this way, souls affiliated to different faiths have been coming down from the Soul World (Param Dham) on to this stage of the world. The population, which was about nine lacs at the start of the Golden Age, increased considerably. At first, there was only one Religion, but now there are many religions, many kingdoms and languages and dynasties. Thus grew mutual strife, divisions and disunity and this shape of affairs continued for 1250 years.</p>
        <h3>Short History of the Iron Age</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Copper Age, which lasted for 1250 years, came Iron Age (Kaliyuga) and more branches and twigs appeared in the Tree, i.e. the Human World. The number of branches grew with further growth of this Tree. Problems, difference of views and disputes began to increase. Those who once belonged to the ancient Deity Religion in India were now over-powered by Tamoguna, i.e., by vices and darkness. They continued taking to wicked ways and became very vicious and impious. The worship of the elements of Nature came in, and the majority made their religion a means of earning money. There was quite a crop of dissensions due to religious, communal and sectarian differences. Women came to be regarded only as an instrument of sexual pleasure. Instead of the respect and status they enjoyed in the Golden Age and Silver Age, they now received contempt only. Nature became instrumental in causing distress to man. Disease, grief, old age, premature death, death by accident, etc. afflicted mankind.</p>
        <h1>Purushottam Sangamayug</h1>
        <img src="../images/Day_4_1.jpg" alt="sangam yug" width=400px; class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short period between the end of Iron Age and the advent of Golden Age is called by the name, Confluence Age, ‘Sangamayuga’ or ‘Purushottamayuga’, the period when men can rise to heights of excellence. During this auspicious and highly beneficial period, Shiva, the Supreme Soul,
        descends here to make India veritable paradise or heaven once again. In the picture of the Kalpa Tree, below the trunk, at the point where the old tree and the new part of the new Tree of the Human World meet, you see them in meditation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The souls that leave their bodies at this time, return to the Soul World (Paramdham), which is also known as Brahmaloka. Before they attain salvation, there is the Divine Adjudicator’s Court (Dharamraj Ka Darbar). They have necessarily to suffer severe punishment (of course, in a subtle manner) for those bad actions whose results have yet to be experienced. Only after this has taken place, do these souls return to the Soul World (Brahmloka) and abide there in the state of Release.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But those souls that had burnt up their past sins by means of Godly Knowledge and Yoga (truely learnt and rightly practised), who had purged themselves of impurities and had acquired divine qualities and had served others by leading them a purification by means of Yoga and had worked well to win victory over the vices, they are very lucky. They have not only not to suffer any punishment in (Dharmraj ki Puri) The region of the Divine Adjudicator, but they proceed majestically to the Soul World (Paramdham). Having stayed there for some time in the state of release, these enter Golden Age at its very start and have uninterrupted, stable and happy enjoyment in the land of the blessed and the free. Thus, this world goes on because, when the present world of human beings decays like an old, rotten tree, then, before it is destroyed, God grafts on it a new world, so that, truely speaking, the world is never completely annihilated.</p>
        <h1>The story of 84 lives of a human soul</h1>
        <img src="../images/Day_4_2.jpg" alt="the ladder" width=400px; class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of the ladder, by means of which is represented the story which the
        Supreme Soul, our wonderful Father, who is the Lord of the Three worlds and who is above birth and death, has related to us. First of all is shown Satyuga. The world of Satyuga which is completely righteous is the veritable Swarga (Paradise) or Vaikuntha (Heaven). Shri Lakshmi and Shri Nãrãyana and their dynasty rule the world then. The average age is 150 years, all this is because there are no disease, sorrow, worry or vice but a truly virtuous nature and outlook. During this period of 1250 years, Shri Narayana’s soul has eight births in the Suryavanshi (Sun) dynasty in the form of a highly respected ruler or as consorts or as members of the ruling dynasty. In this epoch, there are high-souled, excellent persons who are completely viceless (Satoparadhan) and are invested with all good qualities and live under the Divine Law (Daivi Maryada). These people are considered to be of the class of deities (Devata Varna).</p>
        <h3>12 births in Silver Age after having 8 in Golden Age</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Silver Age, the average age of man ranges between 100 and 125 years. In this epoch of 1250 years, Shri Narayana’s soul has 12 births as ruler or as member of the royal family in the Moon Dynasty (Chandravansh). In both the epochs combined, there are 20 lives, full of all happiness. In Silver Age also, there is vicelessness(Satoguna) and people are viceless only upto 14o out of the maximum of 16o. At the commencement of this epoch, Shri Sita and Shri Rama are the rulers, so that even today we speak of the glory that Rama Rajya was. All are happy in that period. They have the rank of what are called Kshatriyas because they are not as pure as their predecessors—the deities—and because they were yet at war with Maya when the world-destruction took place at the end of Iron Age (Kaliyuga) in the previous World Cycle (Kalpa)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in the Copper Age (Dwapuryuga), they become bodyconscious and are led to vices. So, they have a fall, from a deity’s position which is the worship-worthy (Pujya) exalted position, they come down to be just supplicant men or poor worshippers (Pujari). They are of the middle-class or Rajopradhan type. Therefore, their position is that of ‘Vaishyas’—mediocre. During the 1250 years of Copper Age, they take 21 births, either as rulers who are distinguished in their devotion and Bhakti or as exalted members of the public. They, start with the worship of the Incorporeal God, Shiva. This is shown in the picture, the Somnath Temple, and there is shown a King worshipping the Shiva-Linga. And as time passes, they take to worshipping their own former selves (the deities), i.e., the idol of Shri Narayana, etc. Later on, other deities come to be the objects of worship. Scriptures begin to be written, and sacrificial ceremonies performed. This way, Bhakti or devotion becomes, as it were, scattered and adulterated, i.e., instead of being centred on one God, who is the Supreme Soul, people worship several deities and others also.</p>
        <h3>42 Births in Iron Age and one in Confluence Age</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this, comes Iron Age (Kaliyuga). The picture represents how in this epoch, Ravana, i.e. Maya which symbolises the vices, has grown in power over the world. In Iron Age, Tamoguna, the basest form in man—is pre-dominant. All persons are ranked as Shudras. In this epoch, so to say, in this the lowest position, they are born 42 times either as praying, worshipping or supplicating rulers or as among the masses. The sun, trees, fire and other elements also begin to be worshipped. Having thus fallen from the state of communion with God, the Supreme Soul. India, which was once unparalleled in complete peace and happiness, as Paradise always is, now becomes needy, low and insolvent and what you may call ‘hell’.</p>
        <h3>The True story of Satya Narayana</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, Shri Narayana, who was originally viceless worldsovereign in Satyuga, having been born 84 times till the end of Kaliyuga, becomes an ordinary man. When he is in the Vanaparastha stage (fourth quarter of his life), then God, the Supreme Soul, enters his person and gives us Divine Wisdom (Gyãn) to lift us out of impurity, into a world of purity, to put an end to Kaliyuga in order to bring in Satyuga and also to make deities of us men. By virtue of this knowledge, his (Shri Narayana’s) soul attains, in the Confluence Age (Sangamyuga), marjeeva Janma or what is called “the state of spiritual regeneration”. God names him `Prajapita Brahma’</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prajapita Brahmã then receives from God, the Supreme Father, the Divine Knowledge about Him and instruction in easy Raja Yoga and, as a result of all this, obtains in the next birth i.e., in Satyuga, the position of Shri Narayana as was exactly the case 5000 years ago. This very same impious country, India, which had become devilish, fallen and miserable at the end of Kaliyuga, now becomes virtuous, pure, godly and happy. In other words, India, which had become veritable hell is now transformed into heaven. This process is going on at the present time. India is again going to become a Paradise.</p>
        
        <h1>Human souls do not transmigrate into other species to undergo reform</h1>
        <img src="../images/Day_4_3.jpg" alt="rebirth" width=400px; class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the whole of this World Cycle (Kalpa), man is born 84 times and always as a human being and does not have 84 lac (8.4 million) births. Man’s soul is not born in any of the other species, say, of birds and animals. So, the history deals with the rise and fall of man’s soul. If the non-human species are the only ones where pain and sorrow are to be borne by soul, then why should the soul have at all to suffer in human form after having passed through the purgatory of 84 lacs of births? It ought to have complete happiness in human form. But we observe that, in human form also, the souls experience pain as well as pleasure. So, the view that the soul has to enter the world of birds and animals in order to suffer pain is illogical.</p>
        <h3>Souls experience pain in Human species also</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have seen that, among men, there are many kinds of sufferings and more intense at that, than among the other species. A few examples that I would just give you, would make this very clear. The increase in taxes levied by the Government, the worries due to rising prices, the burden of expenditure involved on clothes, food, education, and in observance of customs—to meet these, man has always to worry and to be laying by money. Birds and animals are safe from these worries. They have not to worry about prestige, clothes, housing, furniture and servants. No litigation or election campaigns, no examinations or fear of police—they are not bothered by such kinds of sufferings. It is only human beings who have to endure such worries and pain and anxiety and have to fulfil their needs, desires, longings, implied or explicit, and have to face thousand and one disappointments. All these cause vexations to man. Besides these, Nature, in the form of earth-quakes, floods, etc., and animate beings like reptiles, cause grief to them. When we find that souls of human beings suffer various kinds of pain and disquiet, how can we say that they are to receive punishment only when, after departing from the human body, they go into that of other species? On the contrary, we find that many birds and animals are happier than even human beings. For example, people spend a lot of money on race-horses and domestic dogs. Rich men’s dogs move about in cars, and have milk and bread, whereas in the world today there are millions of men who are tormented with hunger or are begging from door to door for crumbs. People treat them as if they are lower than dogs. They scold them, even push them out and ridicule them. Some dogs cost more than even human beings would. Human beings are engaged as servants to train race-horses, and there are stable-boys and doctors also to look after these horses. Several people have to work to rear horses, to serve them and to look after them. But, there are men who are not lucky enough to get medicine or milk. So, it is clear that human souls experience pleasure and pain even while in the human body and so do the other souls in their respective species. To think that the soul changes in its species in its various lives is utterly wrong.</p>
        <h2>As the seed, so is the fruit</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When man, seeing other men in pain or sorrow, learns to be safe from misdeeds and to be good. A wise man will be prompted to keep away from bad things even when he sees that, among human beings, there are persons who are crippled, paralytic, blind, or lame of legs, leprous, dumb, poor, mad or stupid. He clearly sees among human beings themselves what the result of bad actions is. Therefore, he can draw a lesson from his observation of the suffering in human species rather than from his false belief in transmigration into other species. The soul has or has not gone into an animal’s form by way of punishment—he does not see this. What he does not see, he doubts greatly. Therefore, in order that man may learn to keep from evil, it is not necessary to tell him that his soul will otherwise go into forms other than human. As the seed is, so is the tree and also its fruit. The kernel of a mango will not produce chillies. Exactly in this way, every species has its own souls. Souls of human beings cannot inhabit the bodies of animals or birds. You have already been told that the mind, intellect, (Buddhi) and the Sanskaras are not separate from the soul, but in the soul itself there are the potentialities of the part it has to play. Man’s soul, is therefore, different from the souls of other species in respect of intrinsic qualities.</p>
        <h2>Continuous increase in human population disproves the theory of change of species</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that the population is increasing at an enormous rate. If, on account of vile actions or tendencies, the soul were born in animal’s or a bird’s body the population would not have increased so much but would have decreased very considerably, because in the present epoch, i.e. in Kaliyuga, most souls have, no doubt, ices and bad latencies and do bad actions. Hence, inspite of bad Samskaras and equally bad actions, men’s souls are born in human form and the fact remains that mankind is, everyday, becoming more and more addicted to vices and, hence, they are becoming increasingly subject to sorrows.</p>
        <h1>What part does God play in this Eternal World Drama?</h1>
        <img src="../images/Day_4_4.jpg" alt="world cycle" width=400px; class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s Divine name Immortal form, Eternal Abode and extra-ordinary. Now, in order to understand God’s Divine Acts, you would have to grasp the essential facts about the cycle of this human-world drama, because God’s actions pertain to this world and have to be understood as related to the crisis, to the actors and to the time and place of this Drama.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustration shows the World Drama Wheel. In the middle of it, you will find the Fylfot (Swastika) which divides Time into four equal parts. Religious people consider the Swastika to be very auspicious and they draw it before the commencement of any big work though they do not understand what its real meaning and its importance are.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first part of this Wheel of Time, marked by Swastika, is shown Golden Age (Satyuga). Here, the arm of the Swastika is pointing to the right because the right arm symbolises what is good or what brings about goodness. In these early times, when the cycle started, people of the Sanatan Dharma were possessed of divine qualities and nature and they enjoyed complete purity, 100% peace and complete prosperity. That is why you find that, even today, if a person has good nature, people say; “He is like a deity or like the people of Satyuga.” So too, when anyone is characterless and harms others or if one prematurely dies, or if there is scarcity of food and money, people say: “Dear friend, this is no matter of surprise because we are in Kaliyuga, and these things are nothing unusual in this Age. After all, the present is not Satyuga that we should expect people to be honest and righteous or things to be pure, unadulterated and (excellent) Satopradhan.” From all such common sayings that have been passed on from one generation to another, it is clear that the age called Satyuga was extremely good and the people of that era were really the deities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came Silver Age (Tretayuga). In this era too, people were possessed of purity, peace and prosperity to a very high degree. But the degree (Kala) of their divine qualities had decreased a little, say, they were two degrees less divine than the people of Golden Age who were divine to the extent of 16 degrees. Therefore, the arm of Swastika that indicates this epoch is bent downwards because souls in this era had come down from the state of super-righteousness (Satopradhan) to what is just righteous (Sato-Samanya).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next came Copper Age (Dwapuryuga). Now the souls of the Solar Dynasty of Golden Age and Lunar Dynasty of Silver Age, having experienced beatitude and fruition for many a life, turned to Vam Marga — the path of vices or unrighteousness. That explains why the third arm of the Swastika points to the left, i.e., the arm is reversed because the left hand symbolises what is impure or inauspicious. Now, owing to the fall of the Ancient Deity Religion (Adi Sanatan Devatas Dharma) other religions began to crop up. Islam, established by Abraham, Buddhism founded by the Buddha and Christianity, preached by Jesus Christ, are the main ones among them. People then were second-grade (Rajopradhan) by their nature, qualities and actions. Since mankind was now divided because of various religions, strifes and disputes started to appear and the five vices brought sorrow and disquiet in homes.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadily, the unrighteous doings, i.e., the actions done under the sway of one or the other of these five vices, led the world to more and more impurity and sufferings and the world came under the yoke of Iron Age. Strifes, wars, bellicosity and the resulting peacelessness which had begun showing in Dwapuryuga, increased rapidly in frequency and intensity in Kaliyuga. Therefore, the fourth arm of Swastika is shown raising itself up to indicate the rise in conflicts, clashes and calamities. Then, a stage comes when ignorance, lassitude, stupor(Tamoguna), moral turpitude and sin become predominant. People become devilish by nature and religion becomes utterly degenerate.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Iron Age (Kaliyuga) thus comes to its end, God has to come into the world and perform His actions so as to re-establish Golden Age, (Satyuga), to regenerate man once again into deity and to re-build the foundations of the Adi Sanatan Deity Religion and to re-impart happiness to the suffering humanity; for, God is the only Soul left that never gets defiled and is never overcome by delusion or sufferings. The time when God does this act of creation is called the ‘Sangam Yuga' i.e., the period of confluence of the ending phase of Iron Age(Kaliyuga) and the starting phase of Golden Age (Satyuga). Generally, people have heard something about the four ages, viz, Golden Age, Silver Age, Copper Age and Iron Age; but they do not know anything about the most important and the most auspicious of all epochs i.e. the Confluence Age, the period when God, the Highest Being, descends on the World Drama-Stage and meets us human beings, His beloved children, and gives us the most precious boons of Redemption (Mukti) and Beatitude (Jeevanmukti).</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Confluence-age is also the ‘Amrit Vela’ or the ‘Brahma Muhoorta’ in the true sense of the words for, though we generally consider the confluence of the last phase of night and the first phase of the day as ‘Amrit Vela’ or Brahma Muhoorta, yet in reality, the terms refer to the confluence of the ending phase of Iron Age and the starting phase of Golden Age. Iron Age is the Night due to ignorance and stupor and Golden Age is the Day due to bright character of the people and because it is when these two meet that God gives Amrit (The Nectar of Divine Knowledge) and guides them and, ultimately, takes the souls back to Brahmaloka—the world of liberated Souls, that is why even to-day, people pray to God thus: “Oh God, takes us back Home to be with you.” People call God as the Liberator and Guide. It is because of this function that God is the real Spiritual Guide or Preceptor (Sadguru) of mankind. He is the Supreme Teacher also because He gives us knowledge about Himself, the Creator and teaches us the history of the world—the creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, the Supreme Soul, the World-Father is, in fact, the Doer, the Director, the Guide or the Drawing Force, for He is the only one known as ‘the Ocean of Knowledge’, the ‘Almighty’ and ‘the Redeemer of the sinful’. This Vishwa-Vidyalaya is run on lines laid down by Him—the Incorporeal God-Father. In fact, it is His in all respects. That is why it is known as Ishwariya Vishwa-Vidyalaya. How it is so, will be clear to you as you study further.</p>
