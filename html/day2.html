        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the second day of the course, the focus shifts to the Supreme Soul, its divine qualities, and its relationship with the individual souls. The lesson begins by introducing the Supreme Soul as the Father of all souls, the Ocean of Peace, and the Bestower of Bliss.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Soul, also known as Shiva, is described as a Point-of-Light, residing in Paramdham, the world of souls. It is an incorporeal, self-luminous being, free from birth and death. The Supreme Soul is the Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer of the world, and it descends into the world at the end of each cycle to establish righteousness and grant liberation to souls.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson emphasizes the importance of knowing the Supreme Soul's name, form, abode, and actions. By understanding these aspects, one can establish a deeper connection with the Supreme Soul and receive its divine guidance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day concludes with a reflection on the significance of the Supreme Soul's role in the spiritual journey. By recognizing the Supreme Soul as the Father and Guide, one can attain peace, happiness, and liberation, and become a true child of God.</p>
