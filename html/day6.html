    <h1>Does Gita contain the sermons of the deity Krishna
      or God Shiva?</h1>
    <img src="../images/Day_6.jpg" alt="The Sermonizer of Gita" class="i2">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping in mind all that you have been taught about God, the Supreme Soul, His name, form, abode, acts, etc.— would you consider Shri Krishna to be Bhagwan (God i.e., the Supreme Soul), or to be a Devata (a deity)? You have learnt that God neither is born nor dies nor is reared like a child, nor He has anyone as His father or mother or teacher, because He is Himself the Supreme Father of all, has nothing to do with experience of pleasure or pain and is above and beyond the sphere of action. On the other hand, Shri Krishna was born as others are born and he had parents and a tutor also. You have also been told that Bhagwan is the Creator of the deities—Brahma, Vishnu and Shankar and is, therefore, Trimurti, but Shri Krishna was Vishnu in the corporeal form, and can only be a Devata (deity). Through Prajãpita Brahma, Bhagwãn (God) brings about the establishment of divine religion; through Shankar, He gets the vicious and irreligious people destroyed and, through Vishnu, He accomplishes the sustenance of people belonging to the Golden-Aged and Silver-Aged religion and righteousness. So, Shri Krishna, who is Vishnu in human form, can only be instrumental in sustaining Religion, but not in establishing it or in eradicating Irreligion.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is one. He is not a corporeal Being. He is the self-luminous Point-of-light and the Supreme Father of souls, whatever their religious persuasions be. Can Shri Krishna then be called the Supreme Father of all souls? No. Has God a wife or children as Shri Narayana had? No.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is above pleasure and pain, though it is He who grants us prosperity. But can we consider Krishna to be above pleasure and pain? No.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bhagwan Himself says, “I am the Seed of this World Tree.” Should we regard Krishna as the Seed of the World Tree of human beings or should we regard Shiva as the Seed when we know that Shiva who is the Supreme Soul and is the Father of the Universe and is the conscient Point of-Light, that descends on the person of Prajapita Brahma? Again, Bhagwan says, “I am the unborn; My birth and deeds are all supermundance and divine.” This kind of divine birth is meant the Par-Kaya Pravesh, i.e., the embodying of the soul in another’s body. But, Shri Krishna’s birth was not of this type. Will you then take Shri Krishna to be a Devata (deity) or Bhagwan (God)? do you think that the deity Shri Krishna was the Gita-sermonizer, or you now believe that Gita-Knowledge was given by Bhagwan Himself?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By giving us Knowledge, God makes men to be like Shri Narayana and women like Shri Lakshmi. In other words, He elevates mankind to the status of deities. So, if you take Shri Krishna to be God, whom will you then take to be a deity? those men, who have a double crown and who possess divine virtues are the ones who are called—'deities'. Therefore, the status of Shri Krishna or that of Shri Narayana is the result of the Gita-Knowledge, given by Bhagwan or God; Shri Krishna himself is not God. God is the giver of the boon of sovereign status of Swarga, i.e. Vaikuntha (heaven) and Shri Krishna is thus the Nath, i.e., ruler or say the prince of Vaikuntha.</p>
    <h1>Did the God-sermonizer of Gita goad Arjuna
      for a violent battle?</h1>
    <img src="../images/Day_6_1.jpg" alt="the war against maya" class="i2">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bhagwan descended in this world to re-establish deity sovereignty, i.e., deity-religion, was He there a charioteer in order to fight a gory battle? Would a father make his children fight among themselves? Does a Mahatma (high soul) ever exhort people to fight? Would you take the Supreme Soul, the Supreme Father who is higher than the highest soul, to have been instrumental in bringing about bloodshed? The most important characteristic of Dharma is non-violence. Can He who preaches violence ever set up any high religion, not to speak of deity religion? People entreat God for grant of right discrimination and divine qualities-child, you are the apple of My eye; every moment of Creator of deities; so, He does not degrade people by preaching wars, violence, hate, anger or opposition. You should, therefore, remember that, when God descended, all people were uncultured, fallen from the heights of Yoga and Dharma, fought among themselves and had made this whole world one vast battlefield. This Karmakshetra or world of activity is the real Kurukshetra (the field where the Kurus are engaged) which had, at the time, become actually battle-field for the very simple reason that, in every home, then there were strifes and disputes. So, the Supreme Soul, having then descended on the person of Prajapita Brahma, had taught us to fight Maya (Evil) which consists of the vices of sex-lust, anger, etc. This is the real fight for Dharma, and it is by means of this fight, and not through a bloody war that unhampered sovereignty of Swarga (heavenly kingdom) is accomplished.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must understand also the truth that the body is recognised by all people as the ‘Rath’, i.e., a chariot or vehicle, which the soul rides. There is already in the body of Prajapita Brahma a human soul, and the embodying of Bhagwãn Shiva in that body is a divine entry, which is expressed, in other words, as God’s becoming a Rathi, Sãrathi or Charioteer of Arjuna. This means that, in his body, taken as a chariot, the Supreme Soul also is a rider. But, because people do not understand the real meaning of the words used to express these highly abstruse points of religion, they have given wrong rendering of things, so much so that they have demolished or obliterated the Gita-Knowledge.</p>
    <h1>Purity and Moral Excellence</h1>
    <img src="../images/Day_6_2.jpg" alt="lotus like life" class="i2">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God alone is called ‘the Saviour of the sinners’. Shiva is known as the ‘sworn enemy of sex-lust’. He destroys its root and branch. One of the main ways of cognizing Him is to observe that when He descends. He drives out sex-lust from man, as it were, by boring it out of his body and all along exhorts men to defeat and chase out sex-lust even though he leads the life of a house-holder, for, through their efforts, he has to set up a holy or righteous world of deities where the force of purity and ‘yoga’ is pre-eminent. He places before mankind, as no human being can, the high and clearly visible ideal of non-violence and divine qualities. By this means, man’s soul obtains in this very life complete purity and transcendental joy, because the Supreme Soul confers purity, peace and happiness on us.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People, in general, say that it is impossible for householders to overcome lustful desires and the even saints of ancient times could not control sex-lust. They go so far as to say that desires of this kind have come down to us from times beyond memory and that no harm is done if we indulge in sexual gratification with moderation. But, by embodying Himself in a human being’s body, God, on the contrary, fashions man so as to make him victor over sex-lust and imparts to him excellent Knowledge which gives him bliss and peace here and ensures heavenly happiness.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, you will see that, in Godly Knowledge, there is embeded the acme of excellent moral conduct. Body-consciousness is by that means taken to pieces and man becomes soul-conscious. Even though he lives with his wife, he is either not overcome by sexual desires or comes of with flying colours in his battle with them, or, at least, has the courage to give a good fight to them.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the kind of yoga taught us by God, man’s mind acquires equanimity and begins to turn further away from materiality. To Him is thereby administered such a physic of the hollowness of this world and the fact of the coming destruction that he is completely surfeited with the world. His outlook becomes more and more spiritual, his food is changed to pure and sattwic, type, his life is properly disciplined his dealings become righteous and his sense organs are controlled. His Buddhi is weaned away from sensuality and gets linked with God. Sweetness comes in his habits, while he is ever-ready to serve people with Gyan i.e. God’s Knowledge and he is set on leading a holy life, pure as the lotus.</p>
    <h1>How to Practise Yoga?</h1>
    <img src="../images/Day_6_3.jpg" alt="yoga" class="i2">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever one remembers any person or thing, one is reminded of all that person or thing is, and what one’s association therewith is. Hence, when, at the very start, you have a feeling that you are now here to remember God, your mind will at once be transported to the highest world of eternal Light, which is His abode. The qualities of Shiva, the Supreme Soul, a Point-of-Light in the lightful Shantidhãma will come to your memory, as also the alignments you have with the Supreme Soul Shiva.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that you have not to utter any sound or syllable, nor recite mentally any formula or maxim, but, you have to let yourself easily remember Him, or be conscious of Him, the Supreme Soul, who is in the Incorporeal World, in the way in which the memory of any of your worldly relations or ties comes to you. You will then recollect in some such manner as: “I am a soul... I am a child of the Supreme Soul. He is Jyoti-Bindu—a Point-of-Light, He lives in Paramdham where there pervades Light everywhere and...in reality, I am an inhabitant of that very World. God, the Supreme Father, is an inexhaustible repository of knowledge, peace, bliss and love and is omnipotent and is the Redeemer of the sinful.... He it is who bestows blessedness on all... How very fortunate I am that I have now got right knowledge of Him!...</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Beloved Shiva Baba, I am now yours in all respects! You are the Benefactor of all mankind. I shall now do your bidding, which is the best for me. Father, you are guiding and taking us, to Paramdham and are making us fit for sovereignty in Heaven. You are working wonders in that, in your unbounded compassion for me, you are making me purer and purer every moment and have come down here from Paramdham to teach me and thus grant me health, wealth and happiness that shall last me for 21 lives or 2500 years... Dear Father, You are giving me peace and prosperity that cannot be measured.... Man’s mind will be bathed in ecstasy and he will feel that he is distinct from the body and is as light as the air. He will, in course of time, feel that his old, dirty tendencies are losing hold of him and will, ultimately, let him be. In the state of Yoga, the soul will feel that it is bathing in light and might that are gushing like water from a fountain so that this light and might that he is obtaining from God, are being radiated through him to the world at large.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the preliminary stage of practice in remembering God, latent tendencies will come to the surface because man’s mind has, for several life-times in the past, lost its moorings and meanders and thus got into the habit of wobbling. But, if you remember Him according to the method delineated above, these latencies will be brushed aside. Bad thoughts can be neutralised by good ones or by Knowledge. So, by means of these good thoughts and by remembrance of God, you can make short work of the worthless thoughts. When futile thoughts of all kinds start up, do not be flustered over their appearance nor be swept down with the current, but you should forthwith start thinking of the qualities and deeds of God. Thus will feelings of the contrary kind be, automatically, halted and, after due practice, your remembrance of Him will become free, easy, natural and unhindered.</p>
    <h1>Spiritual Discipline or Divine Rules for a Yogi</h1>
    <img src="../images/Day_6_4.jpg" alt="Pillars of Rajyoga" class="i2">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only he, who observes Spiritual discipline and divine rules, will profit by the knowledge I have given you about God, the Supreme Soul, and about the method of practising blissful remembrance of Him. He, who disregards these rules, cannot experience the true joy of a yogi’s life or the transcendental joys that flow from true Gyan (Divine Knowledge) or the peace that accrues from a life of purity or the bliss that lies in re-union of one’s soul with the Supreme Soul. In order, therefore, to achieve stability in communion with God and in application of Knowledge in life, one must follow the divine rules or the code of spiritual conduct.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brahmacharya or Celibacy; The most essential and the most useful of these rules is to observe Chastity. Sex-Lust is man’s enemy and the worst enemy of yogi. The lascivious man is attached to his body and runs after sensual pleasures, but the yogi dissociates himself from his body and longs with all his heart for a meeting with the Supreme Soul, the incorporeal Supreme Father. Sex-Lust appears to him to be the gateway to Hell, and is as poison; even to think of sex-lust is to him an act of impiety. Without being chaste, man cannot acquire the strength to overcome the other vices and cannot face the troubles that crop up in the path of godliness. Hence, we have to be chaste in all respects, i.e., in thought, word and deed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Righteous Food’ it is very necessary for a yogi to remember that the food he takes is righteous, for it surely has its effect on one’s mind. This axiom is commonly expressed in the saying: “As you eat, so shall you think”, and “as the water you take, so will your speech be”. Because we are striving to become deities, what we take should be absolutely righteous, i.e. Sattwic. Do the worshippers make offerings of onions, garlic, meat, eggs, cigarettes or bidis to God? No, never! They never even think of doing so. As we are using our best endeavours to become pure, we should give up the evil kind of food that unregenerates, take and have instead only what is congenial and helpful to our spiritual endeavours. We should abstain from anything that tends to debase us. Besides this, we have to see that we do not eat food cooked by him who is uncultured in spiritual lore or is given to vice or who is not a yogi at all. What a pleasure it is to have food at the hands of one whose life is almost spotless and who is attuned to God and thus to derive deep bliss in a state of purity, power, peace and sweetness in order to make our life superlatively good!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Righteous company; The kind of company one keeps, influences one’s mind. Badness, inherent in bad company, is in itself a great defect. Man should, therefore, have contacts with only those who converse on topics of Gyan (Divine Knowledge), have interest in communication with God, love Him and wish to progress towards righteousness. Even though you have dealings and transactions with people, you should not take interest in their useless or dirty talk, but should always set your mind in tune with the Supreme Soul, who is the Truth. Otherwise, when you are at your daily practice of yoga, the evil things heard of or about, on that day, will stand in your way.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inculcation of Purity and Divine Virtues; If we do not have practice of this kind often enough our remembrance cannot be duly matured. Therefore, we have to acquire divine qualities like contentment, sweetness, coolness, fortitude, humility, cheerfulness, inwardliness, straightforwardness, sobriety, tolerance, surrender to God and purity in thought, word and deed. He will be a great yogi and later become a great deity according to the extent of his achievement of these divine virtues in the way he leads his life.</p>
