        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the third day, the course focuses on understanding God's deeds and the concept of the World-Wheel. The lesson begins by explaining that God, the Supreme Soul, is the Creator, Sustainer, and Destroyer of the world. God's deeds are high and divine, and they bring about significant changes in the world.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World-Wheel is introduced as a symbolic representation of the cycle of time, consisting of four ages: Satyug, Tretayug, Dwaparyug, and Kaliyug. Each age has its unique characteristics, and the cycle repeats itself every 5000 years. The current period is the confluence of Kaliyug and Satyug, a time of spiritual awakening and transformation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God's deeds are explained in the context of the World-Wheel. In the first age, Satyug, God establishes a righteous world, and the souls are pure and virtuous. In the subsequent ages, the souls become entangled in vices, leading to the decline of virtues and the need for God's intervention.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson emphasizes that the present time is crucial, as it is the period of transition from Kaliyug to Satyug. God descends into the world to establish a righteous world once again, and it is the souls' responsibility to purify themselves and work with God to create a better future.</p>
