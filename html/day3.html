        <h1>Supreme Father of All Souls</h1>

        <img src="images/Day_3.jpg" alt="the supreme soul" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term ‘Supreme Soul’ (Paramatma) means that He is the supreme among all souls. It implies that He also is ‘a soul’, though He is the Highest of all. About Him, it is said that He is above birth and death. Clearly, therefore, this cannot be said about any being who has a body, whether a human body or the one that belongs to some other species. Moreover, He is the Supreme Father of all. Now He, who is the Father of all, must have no father. So, the fact that He is known as the Supreme Father also points out that He does not have a body. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, that’s the reason why all people say that God is Light, a Jyoti (Effulgence personified) or Noor (a self-luminous object). But they do not know what form that Light has. Today, I wish to tell you on the basis of my experience that, just as a soul is a point-of-light (Jyoti Bindu), even so the Father of souls i.e., the Supreme Soul also is a point-of-Light (Jyoti Bindu). </p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All religions have images, idols or memorials, bearing one name or another, to represent this form of Light that God has. Everywhere in Bharat, from Srinagar in the North to Kanya Kumari in the South, images of this form that Shiva has, are found installed; these images are without face or ears or feet or body which fact clearly points out that it is the Symbol of an incorporeal Being. At one place, it is called ‘Vishwanath’ (meaning the Lord of the Universe), at another ‘Amarnath’ (the Father of souls), at a third place it is named Mukteshwara (the Bestower of Liberation) and it bears the name Papkateshwara (meaning the Expiator of sins) at a fourth place. All these names prove that these images represent the Divine Form of God, because none else but the Supreme Soul is the Lord of the world, the Lord of the immortal souls, the Bestower of liberation and the Destroyer of sins. He is God of all Deities, and, being Rama’s God, is rightly remembered as Rameshwara. Being Krishna’s Lord, His memory as Gopeshwara is preserved in a town called Vrindavan, by means of an idol, called ‘Gopeshwara’.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Bharat, there is, in Mecca, an image having this form; the followers of Islam call this image as “Sang-e-Aswad”. Christ, the founder of Christianity also said, “God is Light”. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism also sang the praise of Him who is `All-Light’ and is incorporeal. In olden days, the jews held a stone of this shape in their hands while taking a solemn oath and it is also believed that Moses had vision of this form of God when he saw a Flame behind the bush. I tell you all this about the form of God so that you may be able to stabilise the mind in the remembrance or consciousness of Him and Him alone who is Nirakar and all-effulgent (Jyoti-Swarupa).</p>
        <h1>When does the world need God to act?</h1>
        <img src="images/Day_3_1.jpg" alt="The Trimurtis" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Iron Age (Kaliyuga) thus comes to its end, God has to come into the world and perform His actions so as to re-establish Golden Age, (Satyuga), to regenerate man once again into deity and to re-build the foundations of the Adi Sanatan Deity Religion and to re-impart happiness to the suffering humanity; for, God is the only Soul left that never gets defiled and is never overcome by delusion or sufferings.The tremendous task of uplifting the extremely vicious and degenerate men of Iron Age can be done only by God, the Almighty, who is higher than the deities, i.e., who is the Supreme Soul whom people adore as the ‘Redeemer of the Fallen’ and as ‘the Supreme Lord' of the deities also.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The act of establishment of the new world order (called Satyuga) through Prajapita Brahma.</strong> All those who receive Godly Knowledge and learn easy Sovereign Yoga through Prajapita Brahma, they make their spiritual endeavours with the object of being raised to the Double-crowned deity status, such as that of Shri Lakshmi and Shri Narayana. Having this ideal in view, they do righteous and virtuous deeds and work for complete purity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The act of ending the old world order (called Kaliyuga) through the deity Shankara.</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The act of Sustenance or governance of the world of Golden-Age and Silver-Age done through Vishnu.</strong> In order to understand the function of sustenance or governance, it is necessary for you to first understand what the four arms of Vishnu denote and what the four adornments in the hands of Vishnu represent.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conch in Vishnu’s hands stands for purity of speech, the discus or the wheel symbolises the knowledge of the self and of the world-wheel. The lotus represents purity of actions or uprightness of practical life and the spirit of detachment. The mace denotes victory over the five vices—sex-lust, anger, greed, attachment and arrogance.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two of the arms of Vishnu represent Shri Narayana and the rest two represent Shri Lakshmi. The halo or the crown of light of Vishnu is symbolic of piety and peace and the crown of gold, bedecked with jewels, is an emblem of sovereignty or prosperity.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, by blessing souls with right understanding of the significance of these symbols of Vishnu and by giving them exhilarating visions of Vishnu, the four-armed, God Shiva exhorts mankind to adopt Vishnu as their ideal and He inspires them to take to purity of speech (symbolised by conch), attain the knowledge of the self and the world-drama wheel(represented by the discus), hold on to purity in practical life (of which lotus is the symbol) and thus to win complete victory over vices(symbolised by the mace) and He explains to them that, if they do so, they would attain Double-crowned sovereignty in Heaven.</p>

        <h3>How does God transmute man into deity?</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to uplift man from the lowest rung of moral degeneration and peacelessness to the highest point of purity and happiness, or in other words, to transform an utterly depraved and corrupt human being into a thoroughly noble one, called ‘Narayana’, God-Father Shiva makes his intellect divine and his judgment righteous, because it is surely due to man’s intellect having been debased or his judgement having been defiled that his thoughts, words and deeds have become unrighteous and it is due to his actions having become bad that he is suffering badly. Now, the intellect of a man can be divinised by receiving Divine Knowledge and by turning the intellect away from vices and towards God who is the Purifier and whose remembrance has the peculiar power. Therefore, what God does for the redemption of mankind is simply this that He teaches man Godly Knowledge and easy Raj Yoga because none else can rightly give us the knowledge of God than God Himself can. That is why God alone is adored as the ‘Bestower of Divine Intellect’ and the ‘Giver of the Eye of wisdom’.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as has been repeatedly pointed out, God is Incorporeal. As an Incorporeal Being, God cannot teach His knowledge. For transmission of His knowledge, God requires a medium; He requires an organ of speech. So, just as human beings listen to discourses on Godly Knowledge by means of their ears, God has to impart the Divine Knowledge by the use of a mouth. But, God cannot take a corporeal birth because He is above birth and death; He has no stock of any past actions, of which He should reap the fruit by taking any corporeal form. He is the Mother-Father of all mankind and, therefore, He is not to have any worldly mother and father. He cannot be born as a human baby and be fed and fondled and guarded by men and to have mortal relations with them, because He is (above wordly actions and their fruit) Karmateet. So, the question remains: How does God convey His knowledge to the mankind?</p>
        
        <h1>The descent of God into the body of an
          incognito person</h1>
        <img src="images/Day_3_2.jpg" alt="shivrathri" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After having created the three deities, the Supreme Father Shiva descends from His Supreme Abode (Param Dham) into the body of a mediocre man for, I have already explained that He, the Incorporeal Being, requires a human organ of speech to reveal Divine Knowledge. Such a descent or advent of God into a human being’s body is known as God’s supernatural or Divine Birth or the Divine Presence of God in a particular man’s body. Evidently, God’s Birth is not ordinary as that of human beings; God, by controlling Matter or Nature, is born in an unearthly and supernatural manner. What God does is that He descends from His Supreme Abode daily for some time. He makes the intellect of an aged man the seat of His glory and, lording over him, He uses the mouth of the man for revealing Godly knowledge, and for explaining the way to victory over the vices and to cultivate divine qualities in life and, having done this, He goes back.</p>
        <h3>The name of the person in whose body God Shiva embodies Himself</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God Shiva gives the Divine name ‘Prajapita Brahma’ to the person in whose body He descends. Those who obtain God’s knowledge as revealed through the mouth of this man, Brahma, are called ‘Brahmins’ or ‘Dwijas’, meaning: the twice-born’. Everyone has an ordinary birth, i.e. the physical birth given by one’s parents. But when a man obtains Divine Knowledge from God and his life is metamorphosed considerably, i.e. his soul gets elevated, he is said to have had a new birth which means a spiritual awakening.</p>
        <h1>God Creates Three Deities— Difference between Shiva and Shankara explained</h1>
        <img src="images/Day_3_3.jpg" alt="shiva and shankara" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to accomplish the work of creation, sustenance and destruction, God, first of all, creates three subtle deities, called ‘Brahma’, ‘Vishnu’ and ‘Shankara’. He is, therefore, called ‘Trimurti’, meaning thereby the Creator of the Divine Triad. But since people do not know these recondite truth to-day, they wrongly think that Shiva and Shankara are one and the same person. The fact, however, is that Shankara is a deity created by God Shiva to represent how the world, ultimately gets destroyed. Shiva Himself is incorporeal whereas Shankara has an angelic body. The oval-shaped image, called ‘Shivalinga’ is the image of the Supreme Soul Shiva whereas the image of Shankara is the form of a body.</p>
        <br><br><br>
        <h1>God is not Omnipresent</h1>
        <img src="images/Day_3_4.jpg"  alt="god is not omnipresent" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you give thought to it, you will admit that to regard God as omnipresent is, in a way, to insult Him, because thereby you consider Him to be in all insects, animals and other species of beings, however low these be. It is foolish to think of the Supreme Father as such. The very stones that man tramples upon while walking, the dust particles which are swept with the broom or just swept to be milled up and thrown out, the offal that is so repulsive, the mad dog from whom men for their safety run away, the venomous snake which no one would like to see even in a dream—taking God to be present in these also, point to bankruptcy of one’s wits. He, who is the highest of all the souls in the Three Worlds, who grants salvation and beatitude and purifies sinners and removes all our sorrow and gives us happiness and is our Supreme Father—to regard Him as pervading the tortoise, the alligator, the ass, the dog, etc., is to denigrate and insult Him and to
          earn nothing but sin!</p>
        <h1>Shivaratri—The festival celebrated to
          commemorate God’s Divine birth</h1>
    
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Shivratri Festival also is associated with this epoch, i.e. the Purushottama Sangama Yuga, because God radiates knowledge into this world like the Sun radiates its light, and He removes the darkness of ignorance that had enveloped the world, so as to usher in the day-light of Satyuga. But the people of today do not know anything about this, the best period, i.e., Purushottama Sangamayuga or about Shiva, the Highest, the Supreme Soul, and, therefore, they do not know the greatness of Shivaratri which is the best of all festivals. If people now come to know that Shiva is none other than the Supreme Soul, the Father on High, that Shivratri commemorates His divine birth in the human body of Prajapita Brahma, then people of all faiths would celebrate it as the greatest festival and would recognise the land, called India, as the place where Shiva descended from Paramdhãm and would, consequently, regard it as the holiest centre of Pilgrimage. But, it is painful to find that the people of India say that God is omnipresent and, thereby, they themselves annul the importance of Shivaratri. For, if God is omnipresent, He cannot take any Divine Birth; he cannot take an incarnation, or the question of His descent from Paramdhãm into this world does not arise.</p>
