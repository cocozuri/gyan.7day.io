        <h1>A short note about the institution</h1>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term, Brahma Kumaris, means: ‘the daughters of Brahma’.  It was established by the Incorporeal God, the World-Father, through the Corporeal medium of Prajapita Brahma in 1937. It is through Brahma that the Incorporeal Supreme Father creates the Golden-Aged (Satyugi) world of Purity. From this point of view, all men and women are Brahma’s children or, in other words, Brahma Kumaris and Brahma Kumars, who should live together as loving brothers and sisters belonging to one and the same divine family. The incorporeal Supreme Soul gives Knowledge about Himself through the corporeal medium of Brahma (Adam) and He establishes the first religion, namely the Deity-Religion also through Brahma at the time of creation.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Prajapita Brahma, God has imparted Knowledge to man and taught him virtues. Only those who receive Knowledge through Brahma and observe Brahmacharya and other rules are called the ‘adopted spiritual children of Brahma,’ and become automatically ‘Brahma Kumaris’ and ‘Brahma Kumars’. Even though in a very general manner, all are Brahma Kumars and Brahma Kumaris, yet strictly speaking, only those are rightly to be regarded as such who adopt the good ways taught by God through the corporeal medium of Brahma, follow in practice, God’s Knowledge and practise Rajyoga and Karma Yoga.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, the word ‘Kumar’ does not imply any adolescent youth or a girl, but one who observes Brahmacharya as a child naturally does and who is, like a child, simple in his ways, whether young or old in years, is a ‘Kumar’ or a ‘Kumari’ from spiritual point of view. A King’s son even though grown into manhood is a ‘Raj Kumar’—a, prince. So also he who follows God-Fatherly guidance and advice received through the corporeal medium of Brahma observes continence, is straight-forward like a child and is really a student, such a one is called a ‘Kumar’.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are Kumars as well as Kumaris in this Vishwa-Vidyalaya. If you receive instruction in Godly Knowledge and easy Rajyoga and be holy and yogi, you will also become, by spiritual adoption, a spiritual child of ‘Brahma’, i.e., a ‘Brahma Kumar’. Isn’t it that all those who acquire God’s Knowledge through Brahma and practise it, come into the family of Brahma and shall be called ‘Brahma Kumars’?</p>
        <img src="../images/Day_7_1.jpg" alt="Mamma" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, as women and girls or mothers and sisters are in larger number than men practising it, and as this Knowledge is imparted by mostly mothers and sisters to people, it is called ‘Brahma Kumaris Ishwariya Vishwa-Vidyalaya’. But God does, through Prajapita Brahma, uplift mothers and virgins by making them practise this Knowledge. They have, by nature, comparatively deep faith in God and have greater ability to put into practice the principles of religion besides possessing humility, tolerance and the spirit of service. Brahma’s daughter Saraswati and other Shiv-Shaktis have been regarded as extra-ordinarily proficient. That history is repeating itself again. It can be seen that men too, in sufficient numbers, acquire this Divine Knowledge and, in fact, this Godly Knowledge is meant for men as well as women who live in families and are discharging their social responsibilities, i.e., they belong to the Pravritti Marga, though the fact still remains that more women are the means of spreading this Knowledge.</p>
