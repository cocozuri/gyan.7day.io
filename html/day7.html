        &nbsp;<img src="../images/Day_6_5.jpg" alt="8 Powers" class="i2">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the seventh day, the course emphasizes the importance of spiritual discipline and the cultivation of divine virtues. The lesson begins by explaining that spiritual discipline is essential for spiritual growth and liberation. It involves various practices such as chastity, righteous food, daily study of divine knowledge, and the observance of divine rules.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chastity, or Brahmacharya, is highlighted as a crucial aspect of spiritual discipline. It is the practice of abstaining from sexual activities and maintaining purity in thought, word, and deed. By observing chastity, souls can attain spiritual strength and focus their energy on spiritual endeavors.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Righteous food, or Sattwic food, is also emphasized as an important aspect of spiritual discipline. It involves consuming food that is pure, simple, and conducive to spiritual growth. By eating righteous food, souls can maintain a healthy and balanced body, which supports their spiritual practices.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daily study of divine knowledge is another essential practice. It involves attending spiritual classes, reading scriptures, and reflecting on divine teachings. By engaging in daily study, souls can deepen their understanding of spiritual principles and apply them in their lives.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lesson also introduces the concept of divine virtues, which are qualities that souls should strive to cultivate. These virtues include contentment, sweetness, coolness, fortitude, humility, cheerfulness, inwardliness, straightforwardness, sobriety, tolerance, surrender to God, and purity in thought, word, and deed. By practicing these virtues, souls can transform their character and become more like deities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day concludes with an encouragement to put these teachings into practice and strive for spiritual excellence. By following spiritual discipline and cultivating divine virtues, souls can attain liberation and become instruments of God's work in establishing the New World.</p>
